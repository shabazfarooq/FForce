# FForce

Expected Commands:

init (sets up org, basically create-force-login)
  create the package.xml file as well as the build.properties file now

update-password
  (in credentials.json and I gusss force somehow too, and build.xml)

create
  (creates for apex class, apex trigger, apexpage, apexcomponent)
  â€” future: aura

test [test methods] [class coverage]

save



.. know the current folder this is being called from, with that we can pop up to 3 to find credentials.json, otherwise call it quitzees


Debug logs? hrmmmm what you think what you think? Maybe we do it in python, what you think what you think??
